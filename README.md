# Aspect-Term-Extraction

This project seeks to explore the topic of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and focuses on the fundamental step of ABSA, which is the Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) task. Taking the supervised learning pathway, we experimented with both the binary target classifictaion approaches (Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, LR) and the BIO sequence labeling approaches (RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM) to address the task. 

We tested the models against the Restaurant and Laptop datasets and conclude that Bi-LSTM, among all RNN-based models, achieves the best performance. Conditional random fields (CRF) layer and character embedding can further enhance the performance of a Bi-LSTM model.

Furthermore, we evaluate model performances not only from a macroscopic level using parameters like accuracy and F1 score but also from a microscopic level using specific error cases selected from the dataset to understand and explain the impact of the model architecture on the dataset.
